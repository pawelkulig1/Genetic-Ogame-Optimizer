# Genetic-Ogame-Optimizer

This project is my attempt on creating perfect solution for Ogame browser game. First I have to develop way to test my building orders this is why big part of this project is game simulator. Simulator is meant to allow user calculate time it would take to construct given buildings(for now only buildings) order (resources loading times are taken into calculations). This simulation then will help me create algorithm to find game solution based on required target. Example target may be fastest way to reach small cargo or first colony.
