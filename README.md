# Genetic-Ogame-Optimizer
#### ABOUT OGAME
This project is my attempt on creating perfect solution for Ogame browser game. Ogame is game where player has to build economy, invade other players, develop technologies and fleet. <br>

#### Project Aim
Aim of this project is to develop perfect way of investing resources in Mines. To achieve this I will use Genetic Algorithms, but first I have to develop way to test suggested building orders (fittness of genome). This is why big part of this project is Ogame simulator. Simulator is meant to allow user calculate time it would take to construct given buildings(for now only buildings) order (resources loading times are taken into calculations). After finishing Ogame simulator i will focus on developing genetic algorithm to find fastest way of colonizing first planet.
